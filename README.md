### Description

Have you ever seen a picture that looks like a picture of something, but when you came up close you saw it was really made up of a lot of different pictures? This example shows you how to create a picture like that. It takes a picture of Drew Carey and creates a big picture of that picture out of little pictures of that same picture. It's kind of neat.
